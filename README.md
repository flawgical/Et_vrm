Visitor Registration Manager For Small Business

```
This is a Visitor Registration Manager that allows small business's to keep track of their check-in/check-out process.
The VRM provides notifications to admins on check in process via email/text/etc.

The check-in includes a form that asks for Name, Appointment Time, Arrival Time.
There are two types of check-in. Adult and Child. The Child needs a separate form that proves the existence of a legal guardian.
There might be photograph and signature options.
Other things coming soon!
